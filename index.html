    <div class="intro">
      How do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not alive? Let's explore the characteristics that define life.

        <div class="card-title"><span>1</span>Visible Movements as Evidence for Being Alive üëÄ</div>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Often, we think of some sort of movement as common evidence for being alive.</li>
          <li><b>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In Animals & People:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>A dog running</li>
                <li>A cow chewing <b>cud</b> (partly digested food that animals like cows bring back from their stomach to chew again)</li>
                <li>A person shouting</li>
                <li>Even when asleep, we see them breathing, which is a type of movement</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>üå± In Plants:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>They grow over time, which is a growth-related movement.</li>
                <li>They are often green.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Using only visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.</li>
                <li>A plant can be alive without visibly growing.</li>
                <li>Some animals can breathe with very little motion.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="card-title"><span>2</span>The Invisible Movement Necessary for Life üî¨</div>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>The true sign of life is movement on a very small scale, one that is invisible to the naked eye.</li>
            <li>This is the constant movement of <b>molecules</b> (the tiny building blocks that make up everything).</li>
            <li>Professional biologists agree that this invisible molecular movement is necessary for life.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="card-title"><span>3</span>The Curious Case of Viruses ü¶†</div>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Viruses are a puzzle.</li>
          <li>They do not show any molecular movement on their own.</li>
          <li>They only become active when they infect some cell.</li>
          <li>This is why there is a <b>controversy</b> (a long-lasting scientific debate) about whether they are truly alive or not.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="example-card">
        <div class="card-title"><span>4</span>Why are Molecular Movements Needed for Life? ‚ù§Ô∏è</div>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>This constant movement is all about keeping the organism's structure from breaking down.</li>
          <li><b>üß¨ Well-Organised Structures:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Living organisms have highly organised structures:</li>
                <li>Tissues ‚Üí which are made of Cells ‚Üí which have smaller components ‚Üí all made of molecules.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>‚ö†Ô∏è The Threat of Breaking Down:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>Because of the effects of the environment, this organised, ordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down over time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
           <li><b>üõ†Ô∏è The Need for Maintenance:</b>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>If this order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive.</li>
                <li>Therefore, living creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.</li>
                <li>Since these structures are made of molecules, they must move molecules around all the time.</li>
            </ul>
